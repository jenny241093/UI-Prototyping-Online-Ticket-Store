1. Online Ticket Store
2. Requirements
Create a Web-based application for selling tickets for various venues (concerts, festivals, theater plays, etc.). The web application is supposed to include two parts:
Categorized catalog of venues with ability to view detailed information and purchase tickets
Administration interface for addition, editing and deletion of events
Provide the following functionality to all visitors (without authentication):
View upcoming events
Browse categories of events
Advanced search (by category, date, price, location, etc.)
View details about an event (information, location, date, price and availability of tickets)
In addition to the previous functionality, registered users can:
Purchase tickets
Manage their profile
Authenticated administrators should be able to:
Create / edit / delete events
Manage available tickets
Ticket count is updated live, to avoid conflicts. When purchasing a ticket, a user registration is required, but product basket is preserved.
Create a Web UI prototype for the Online Ticket Store system.
